# Rush Hour 

Rush hour board game implemented using python.

The algorithm uses Depth First Search to find the next possible states of the board and solves it using Random Walk, Breadth First Search and A* algorithm.

### Execution steps
The run.sh file is used to interact with the game.

A few sample commands are:

```
bash run.sh print
bash run.sh done
bash run.sh next
bash run.sh random
bash run.sh bfs
bash run.sh astar
```

You can also provide your own board with any of the above commands.
For example:

```
bash run.sh print "  ooo |ppp q |xx  qa|rrr qa|b c dd|b c ee"

```
