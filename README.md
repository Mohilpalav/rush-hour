# Rush Hour 

***This code was written as part of the coursework of the CS-510 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence) course at Drexel University.***

Rush hour board game implemented in python.

The algorithm uses Depth First Search to find the next possible states of the board and solves it using Random Walk, Breadth First Search and A* algorithm.

### Execution steps
Clone the repository and use the run.sh file to interact with the game.

A few sample commands are:

```
bash run.sh print
bash run.sh done
bash run.sh next
bash run.sh random
bash run.sh bfs
bash run.sh astar
```

You can also provide your own board with any of the above commands.
For example:

```
bash run.sh print "  ooo |ppp q |xx  qa|rrr qa|b c dd|b c ee"
```
